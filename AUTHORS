Haskell bytestring-trie package AUTHORS/THANKS file:

The bytestring-trie package was written by wren ng thornton and is
released under the terms in the LICENSE file. I would also like to
give thanks to the following contributers:

Maxime Henrion --- for the Binary (Trie a) instance and extensive
debugging work including almost all of the QuickCheck properties.

Don Stewart --- for fostering the idea and offering feedback on
when the unsafe is safe in the internals of ByteStrings.

Mark Wotton --- for benchmarking work comparing Trie to Map ByteString,
and for debugging.
