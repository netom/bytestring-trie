The bytestring-trie library provides an efficient implementation of ``dictionaries'' mapping strings to values, using big-endian patricia tries (like \texttt{Data.IntMap}). In general \texttt{Trie} is more efficient than \texttt{Map ByteString} because memory and work is shared between strings with common prefixes, though the specifics will vary depending on the distribution of keys.

\FuturePlans
\begin{itemize}
\item Min- and max-views for treating tries as priority queues.
\item Efficient intersection and difference functions.
\end{itemize}

\FurtherReading
\begin{itemize}
\item Official source and documentation available on Hackage.
\item The development branch is available from \url{http://community.haskell.org/~wren/}.
\end{itemize}
